Progressive Revelation,"OT violence reflects partial, culturally-conditioned revelation; Christ’s teachings supersede violent precedents.","Jael’s violence is a product of her time, not a universal moral model; Christ’s ethic of nonviolence now prevails.","Strong alignment with NT nonviolence; risks undermining OT authority and unity of Scripture.","May downplay original intent; can be seen as reinterpreting rather than explaining the text.","Clear rejection of violence as a Christian ethic; may struggle with questions about justice and authority.","Strong in theory, but extremists may ignore or reject its theological sophistication."
Divine Command Theory,"God’s commands for violence were specific to time, place, and people; not universal or ongoing mandates.","Jael’s act was permitted in a unique historical context, not a template for today.","Maintains unity of God’s character; upholds both justice and mercy; preserves authority of both Testaments.","High fidelity: respects historical, literary, and covenantal context.","Prevents direct application of OT violence; allows for nuanced discussion on justice and authority.","Very strong: emphasizes non-transferability of commands, making misuse difficult."
Literary/Hyperbolic Reading,"OT war accounts use conventional, exaggerated language typical of ancient Near Eastern literature; not all violence is literal.","Jael’s story uses dramatic, literary techniques to emphasize deliverance, not to prescribe behavior.","Consistent with understanding of ancient rhetoric; may risk minimizing theological content if over-applied.","Strong: highlights literary conventions and original audience understanding.","Limits literal application; focuses on theological message over direct moral imitation.","Strong: makes literalist, violent readings difficult by exposing rhetorical conventions."
Redemptive-Historical,"OT violence served a specific role in salvation history, pointing to Christ and ultimate redemption; not a pattern for post-Christ behavior.","Jael’s act is part of God’s plan to deliver Israel and preserve the messianic line; not a model for Christian action.","Good: integrates OT and NT, showing continuity and fulfillment in Christ.","Moderate: may impose typology beyond original intent, but respects salvation-historical context.","Directs Christian ethics toward spiritual, not physical, warfare; discourages “culture war” mentality.","Moderate: points violence to God’s redemptive plan, but some may still misuse judgment motifs."
